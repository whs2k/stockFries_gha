      <h4 class="card-title text-center">What are Hedge Funds Shorting?
</h4>
    <p class="card-text text-center">Inspired by the great work by investors from <a href = "https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/">r/WallStreetBets</a> here are all the most recent Puts from our list of Hedge Funds (based on their most recent filings). A put option is technically different than a short sale, yet both make money when a security goes down in price.
    <br>
    A put option gives the holder the right to sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price, while a short sale involves borrowing and selling a stock with the expectation that the price will decline. In a put option, the holder incurs a cost but has limited risk, as they only sell if they choose to exercise the option. In a short sale, the potential loss is unlimited as the price of the stock could rise indefinitely. The difference between the sale and repurchase price is the profit in a short sale, while in a put option the profit is made by selling the asset at the higher strike price.
    <br>
    NOTE that Hedge funds may use Put options in conjunction with a Call Option or buying shares of a security to limit or, hedge, their portfolio's risk. For example, if George Soros buys $1B of Amazon stock, they may also purchase $1M in put options. Then if the stock goes down beyond a certain point, they can execute the Put and limit their losses.
